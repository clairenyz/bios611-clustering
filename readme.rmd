# BIOS611 Clustering Assignment

This repo implements:

- **Task 1**: Gap Statistic to determine when k-means stops recovering `n` clusters as hypercube centers move closer.
- **Task 2**: Spectral clustering on concentric shells with a `clusGap`-compatible wrapper and a Plotly 3D preview.

## How to run

```bash
make all
# or run tasks separately
make task1
make task2

## Discussion 

As shell radius increases, the same number of points must cover a larger spherical surface area. This decreases local point density, leading to weaker graph connectivity, which makes spectral clustering less effective.

For fair comparisons, one could increase sample size with radius or set an adaptive affinity threshold.

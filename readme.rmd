# BIOS611 Clustering Assignment

This repo implements:

- **Task 1**: Gap Statistic to determine when k-means stops recovering `n` clusters as hypercube centers move closer.
- **Task 2**: Spectral clustering on concentric shells with a `clusGap`-compatible wrapper and a Plotly 3D preview.

## How to run

```bash
make all
# or run tasks separately
make task1
make task2
